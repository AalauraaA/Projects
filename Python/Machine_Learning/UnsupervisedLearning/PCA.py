UNSUPERVISED LEARNING - UNSUPERVISED TRANSFORMATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is two types of unsupervised learning: unsupervised transformation and 
clustering.

With unsupervised transformation a dataset is transform into a new representation
of the dataset with some algorithms such as the dimensionality reduction or 
extraction of features/topics.

With clustering the dataset is partition into distinct groups of similar items.

The major challenge with unsupervised learning is that you do not have a known 
output to evaluate the algorithm to see if it good. You use unsupervised 
learning algorithms when your data do not contain any labels. Because of this 
unsupervised learning algorithms are often used in a exploratory setting to 
understand the data better than used it as an automatic system. Unsupervised
learning is also used as a preprocessing step for the supervised algorithms as
the knowlegde of the data can help the accuracy of the supervised algorithms.
