Exercise
Develop an MLP for the MNIST
database by using the dimension-reduced data from your work on Exercises 2 and 3. You can download the LDA projected data here.
Further, you can use 10-, 20- and 30-dimensional data generated by PCA and compare
their performance (at the same time, try various MLP architectures).
Functions for MLP in the NETLAB toolbox include mlp.m,
mlptrain.m and mlpfwd.m.
