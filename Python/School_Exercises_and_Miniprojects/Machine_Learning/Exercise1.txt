Exercise
Download dataset1_noisy (generated from handwritten digits database) available in the end of this page and do the following exercise:

You are given, as the train data, trn_x and trn_y along with their class labels trn_x_class and trn_y_class. The task is to classify the following TEST data.
(a) classify instances in tst_xy, and use the corresponding label file tst_xy_class to calculate the accuracy;
(b) classify instances in tst_xy_126 by assuming a uniform prior over the space of hypotheses, and use the corresponding label file tst_xy_126_class to calculate the accuracy;
(c) classify instances in tst_xy_126 by assuming a prior probability of 0.9 for Class x and 0.1 for Class y, and use the corresponding label file tst_xy_126_class to calculate the accuracy; compare the results with those of (b).

To plot Gaussian, you may use PLOT_GAUSSIAN_ELLIPSOID.
