Theme: Understanding Boxplots
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boxplot is a way of displaying the distribution of data:
    * Minimum
    * First quartile (Q1)/25th percentile
        - The middel number between the smallest number which is not the minimum 
          and the median of the dataset.
    * Median (Q2)/50th percentile
        - The middel value of the dataset.
    * Third quartile (Q3)/75th percentile
        - The middel value between the median and the highest value which is 
          not the maximum of the dataset.
    - Maximum
    
A boxplot tells you about:
    * Outliers and their values
    * Symmetry in your data
    * How tightly your data is grouped
    * If your data is skewed

A boxplot is a graph that gives a good indication of how the values in the 
data are spread out. It take less space than a histogram or density plot
which come in hand when you want to comparing distributions between different
group of data.

# Boxplot on a Normal Distribution

"""
The PDF is used to specify the probability of the random variable falling 
within a particular range of values. The probability is given by the integral
of this variables PDF over that range. 

The PDF for the normal distribution is given by:

     f(x) = 1.0 / np.sqrt(2*np.pi) * np.exp((-(x-mu)**2) / (2.0 * sigma2))

If we have mean/mu = 0 and the standard deviation/sigma2 = 1 then the PDF of
the normal distribution becomes a Gaussian distribution and is given as:
    
    f(x) = 1.0 / np.sqrt(2*np.pi) * np.exp((-x**2) / 2.0)

The area under the curve must be 1 (the probability of drawing any number from 
the functionâ€™s range is always 1).
